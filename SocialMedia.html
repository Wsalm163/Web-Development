			<h2>The Endless Scroll </h2>
			This tactic is employed by feeding the user an unending stream of handpicked content.
			It preys on the human brain's subconscious search for endings as a sign to move onto another activity.
			Because there is not an end to the content, the brain does not receive a subconscioussign to move to another activity.
			Also this mimics a slot machine in that it is an random intermittent reward generated by a simple movement.
			This reward takes the form of a finding a particularly funny meme or interesting post or video.

				<h2>Social Pressure and Reward</h2>
				Most forms of social media have something akin to a "like" with which users can reward each other.
				This seems harmless enough but if some users begin to crave the feelings brought on by receiving lots of likes for a post.
				Then there is the social pressure. In some places it is seen as a social offence to deny a friend request from someone.
				Most forms of communication across social media have a read feature, which tells users when their message has been read by the recipient.
				The social pressure comes in feeling a need to respond to a message instead of leaving someone "on read"
				Some forms of social media even make it known when the other person has the conversation open, thus presurring the user to not be the first to leave the conversation and respond immediately

			Seriously technology overuse is bad for you. Limit yourself to 2 hours a day and see how you feel after a week. <br>
			 Go outside, read a book, do some push-ups, go talk to someone just stop staring at your screens for entertainment.
