				<h2>Returning play</h2>
				One Tactic used by some phone is that of Returning Play.
				This tactic preys on the fact that the human brain recognizes beginnings and ends. 
				if we are interuppted during one activity we are far more likely to return to that activity.
				Some apps such as Duolingo use mechanics such as "lives" to interupt the player, saying they need to come back later when their lives have regenerated.
				Other apps many with the title "idle..." reward the player for returning to the app.
				Many of these games also use the Endless play tactic in order to keep users for longer.

				<h2>You See What You Like</h2>
				Some apps have algorithims to analyse what you use and watch most. 
				It's no secret that your phone listens to your conversations and then personalizes it's advertisments to you.
				Not only is that invasive, this tactic is used to show users more of what they like even if they do not push the like button
				Some apps moniter how much time you spend hovering over pieces of content and then seeks out similar content and advertisments to show you.
				This keeps users on these apps as they are enjoying what the are seeing and playing and buying.

			Seriously technology overuse is bad for you. Limit yourself to 2 hours a day and see how you feel after a week. <br>
			 Go outside, read a book, do some push-ups, go talk to someone just stop staring at your screens for entertainment.
