				<h2>Endless play</h2>
				One Tactic used by some Video Games is Endless Game Play.
				This tactic preys on the fact that the human brain recognizes beginnings and ends. 
				Our brains recognize an ending and are more likely to move on to another activity once one activity is completed
				Additionally if we are interuppted during one activity we are far more likely to return to that activity.
				Most Open World video games such as Skyrim and Fallout do not have an 'end' at which the story is finished, it is objective after objective in a near endless stream of entertainment.
				This makes it difficult to put down games like these and increase the chance of returning to the game later.

				<h2>Loot boxes</h2>
				A loot box is a in game prize which gives the player a chance at receiving in-game items and cosmetics.
				This type of random intermittent reward system provides nearly identical stimulation to the brain as a casino slot machine would.
				This slot-machine-like reward system has been banned in certain countries and has caused certain gaming corporations to recieve lawsuits for violating online gambling laws.
				Certain companies have even admitted to using predatory tactics to direct players towards purchasing these lootboxes.
				This type of intermittent rewards system is one of the most addictive things in the world.

			Seriously technology overuse is bad for you. Limit yourself to 2 hours a day and see how you feel after a week. <br>
			 Go outside, read a book, do some push-ups, go talk to someone just stop staring at your screens for entertainment.
