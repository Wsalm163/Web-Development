				<h2>Our mission</h2>
				Technology is a wonderful and fantastic tool for us all to enjoy. 
				We have near infinite amounts of information and entertainment at our fingertips and in our pockets. 
				However we need to make sure that we are using these tools correctly.
				Sadly some forms of electronic use are designed to addict its users.
				This addiction is ubiquitous in our society and causes the users to feel less joy in even their favourite activities.
				Our objective is to educate and inform people about these problems and help people to learn how to use their devices in a healthy manner.

				<h2>How much is too much?</h2>
				In our daily lives we look at devices and screens constantly.
				So what is the proper amount of screen use?
				Experts recommend that children under 2 years of age should not have recreational screen time.
				For children aged 2 to 5 years, recreational screen time should be limited to 1 hour per day.
				Everyone older than 5 years should limit their daily recreational screen time to 2 hours.
